<h2>Description</h2>

In this project, I’ve created a home lab environment to explore and practice Active Directory (AD) concepts. Let’s break down the steps:

1. Oracle VirtualBox Installation:
   - Begin by downloading and installing Oracle VirtualBox. This virtualization software will allow us to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) within our lab environment.

Download the platform package to your specific OS: <br/>

2. Operating System ISOs:
   - Obtain the **Windows 10** and **Windows Server 2019** ISO files. These will serve as the installation media for our VMs.
   - We'll install each operating system on separate VMs.

3. Creating the Domain Controller (DC):
   - Create your first VM, which will act as the domain controller (DC). The DC hosts Active Directory (AD) and manages user authentication.
   - Configure two network adapters for this VM:
     - One adapter connects to the external internet.
     - The other connects to a private network within VirtualBox (where client VMs will connect).

4. Installing Windows Server 2019 on the DC:
   - Install Windows Server 2019 on the DC VM.
   - Assign IP addresses for the internal network (the external network will get IPs from your home router).

5. Configuring Active Directory:
   - Name the server.
   - Install Active Directory services.
   - Create your domain.
   - Configure routing so that clients on the private network can access the internet through the DC.

6. Setting Up DHCP:
   - Configure DHCP on the DC. This ensures that when we create a Windows 10 client VM, it automatically receives an IP address.

7. PowerShell Script for User Creation:
   - Before creating client VMs, run a PowerShell script.
   - This script will automatically create a thousand users in Active Directory.
   - Explore the script to understand how PowerShell can be used for automation and administration tasks.
