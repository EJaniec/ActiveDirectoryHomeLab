<h2>Description</h2>

In this project, I’ve created a home lab environment to explore and practice Active Directory (AD) concepts. Let’s break down the steps:

1. Oracle VirtualBox Installation:
   - Begin by downloading and installing Oracle VirtualBox. This virtualization software will allow us to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) within our lab environment.

<br />

2. Operating System ISOs:
   - Obtain the **Windows 10** and **Windows Server 2019** ISO files. These will serve as the installation media for our VMs.
   - We'll install each operating system on separate VMs.

3. Creating the Domain Controller (DC):
   - Create your first VM, which will act as the domain controller (DC). The DC hosts Active Directory (AD) and manages user authentication.
   - Configure two network adapters for this VM:
     - One adapter connects to the external internet.
     - The other connects to a private network within VirtualBox (where client VMs will connect).

4. Installing Windows Server 2019 on the DC:
   - Install Windows Server 2019 on the DC VM.
   - Assign IP addresses for the internal network (the external network will get IPs from your home router).

5. Configuring Active Directory:
   - Name the server.
   - Install Active Directory services.
   - Create your domain.
   - Configure routing so that clients on the private network can access the internet through the DC.

6. Setting Up DHCP:
   - Configure DHCP on the DC. This ensures that when we create a Windows 10 client VM, it automatically receives an IP address.

7. PowerShell Script for User Creation:
   - Before creating client VMs, run a PowerShell script.
   - This script will automatically create a thousand users in Active Directory.
   - Explore the script to understand how PowerShell can be used for automation and administration tasks.
